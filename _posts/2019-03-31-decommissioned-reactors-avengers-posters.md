I recently noticed a Twitter thread by [@darth](https://twitter.com/darth/status/1110620014330023937) that placed the "Avenge The Fallen" tagline of the upcoming *Avengers: Endgame* movie on top of deceased characters. So, in the spirit of fun-yet-educational content, I created this series of images about decommissioned commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S.

This post is expanded off of a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/nuclearkatie/status/1110964781694009344) with much of the same content, but with many more broken links (oops). I'd recommend reading the content here.

Some quick terminology first. This article only consists of commercial nuclear plants that have been officially designated by the [NRC](https://www.nrc.gov) as decommissioned or decommissioning. Once a reactor has been permanently shut down, it takes years or decades to fully dismantle it and return the land, and these reactors are in varying stages of the process. Some have been returned to "greenfield" status, where no buildings remain and the land has been released for unrestricted use. Others have only recently shut down and no decommissioning activities have yet taken place.

Some terms used in decommissioning a nuclear reactor
* DECON is the status where a reactor is currently being dismantled. Some plants enter DECON shortly after shutdown, while others remain in standby before entering DECON.
* SAFSTOR basically means putting the reactor in a safe monitored state and waiting years or decades to let some of the radioactive materials with short half-lives decay away. This exposes workers to much less dose when dismantling but obviously takes a much longer time.

Finally,
* ENTOMB means encasing the site in concrete. We have never done this in the US and there are no plans to do so. The famous sarcophagus surrounding Chernobyl unit 4 is an example of ENTOMB.

And now without further ado, The Fallen

### Elk River

![Elk River](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/elk-river.jpg)

Elk River (MN) was a small, 60 MWt reactor built for the Rural Cooperative Power Association (RCPA). It operated from 1962 to 1968 and was dismantled and decommissioned by 1974. On the same site a coal/oil-fired plant operated until 1989 before being converted to run on refuse. It was recently announced that the refuse plant [will close](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/22/elk-river-garbage-burning-power-plant-to-close) due to low electricity prices.

### Pathfinder

![Pathfinder](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/pathfinder.jpg)

Pathfinder (SD) was a proof-of-concept reactor that used superheated steam but never operated at its full power of ~200 MWt. The reactor vessel was removed 23 years after the reactor was shut down and the plant operated as an oil/gas-fired peaking plant until 2000. The US has not used superheated reactors since Pathfinder.

### Fort St. Vrain

![Fort St. Vrain](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/fort-st-vrain.jpg)

Fort St. Vrain (CO) was a high-temperature gas reactor, the second to be built in the US. Unfortunately, it had measly 14% [capacity factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor), dismal even for the much lower national average in the 1980's. After the reactor was decommissioned in 1992, the facility was converted to natural gas combustion (and eventually [natural gas combined-cycle](https://www.ge.com/power/resources/knowledge-base/combined-cycle-power-plant-how-it-works)). It still operates today and its owner, [Xcel Energy](https://www.xcelenergy.com) operates an [Eagle Cam](https://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/xcel-energy-cams/) on site.

### Rancho Seco

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/rancho-seco.jpg)

Racho Seco (CA) operated from April 1975 to June 1989 and was closed by a public vote by Sacramento citizens. It had a troubled history of shutdowns, accidents, and cost overruns. The plant completed DECON and the U.S. [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://www.nrc.gov) (NRC) recently [approved](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/11/2018-19602/sacramento-municipal-utility-district-rancho-seco-nuclear-generating-station) the site for [unrestricted release](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1402.html).

### Saxton

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/saxton.jpg)

Saxton (PA) was a small 23.5 MWt reactor. Although it produced power as a commercial plant, it was designed mainly as a research station. It was shut down in 1972 and has completed decommissioning

### Shoreham

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/shoreham.jpg)

Shoreham (NY) was built on Long Island and faced constant [public opposition](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1979/6/4/police-arrest-500-protesters-at-ny/) during construction. It was never given a NRC license to operate and eventually [sold its unused fuel](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/13/nyregion/dismantling-of-the-shoreham-nuclear-plant-is-completed.html) to the Philadelphia Electric Company. It has been fully decommissioned.

### Yankee Rowe

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/yankee-rowe.jpg)

[Yankee Rowe](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=yankee+rowe+nuclear&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) (MA) was the first nuclear plant in the northeast. Sometimes referred to as just Rowe, the plant began commercial operation in 1961 and was shut down in 1992 due to reactor pressure vessel embrittlement concerns and economic factors. Decommissioning was completed in 2007.

### Trojan

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/trojan.jpg)

Trojan (OR) successfully defeated [1986, 1990, and 1992 ballot measures](https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf) to close or prohibit operation of the plant. However, cracks and leaks of steam generator tubes lead to an early shutdown in 1993. The plant has [completed decommissioning](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0514/ML051430407.pdf) and the land

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/haddam-neck.jpg)

[Haddam Neck/Connecticut Yankee](http://www.connyankee.com/index.html) (CT) operated for nearly 29 years but was closed due to its high operational costs, especially compared to the low price of oil and gas at the time. It underwent DECON, which was completed in 2007

### Maine Yankee

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/maine-yankee.jpg)

[Maine Yankee](http://www.maineyankee.com) (ME) operated as Maine's only nuclear plant from 1972 through 1996. It was the state's largest generator of electricity but like other plants in the northeast, it was shut down over lack of economic viability. During its tenure, three state-wide anti-nuclear energy referenda in 1980, 1982, and 1987 failed to close the plant. DECON was completed in 2005

### Big Rock Point

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/big-rock-point.jpg)

Big Rock Point (MI) was the fifth commercial nuclear power plant in the U.S. It was named after a large boulder that the [Odawa](https://www.petoskeyarea.com/media-information/area-history/odawa-indians/) used as a gathering point. The plant was shut down in 1997 and has completed DECON

### Fermi 1

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/fermi-1.jpg)

Fermi 1 (MI) was a prototype sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor that suffered a partial core meltdown. The reactor remained shut down for four years before eventually being restarted for a short time before permanent shutdown. Fermi Unit 2, a BWR, is still operational on site.

### Indian Point 1

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/indian-point-1.jpg)

[Indian Point](http://www.safesecurevital.com/#) I (NY) was a 615 MWt PWR. The initial core load used thorium fuel. It sits in SAFSTOR as the other two units on site are still operational. In 1972, Indian Point owner [Con Edison](https://www.coned.com) was fined for killing fish due to the plant's heated discharge water. The fine was $500 plus $10 for every fish killed, which added up to a massive $1.5 million.

### Peach Bottom 1

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/peach-bottom-1.jpg)

Peach Bottom 1 (PA) was the first high-temperature gas reactor in the US and operated from 19967 to 1974. While the fuel has been removed and the spent fuel pool decontaminated, most of the plant still remains in SAFSTOR. Two BWR units remain operational on site

### Three Mile Island 1 and 2

![](assets/images/posts/2019/reactors-avengers/tmi-2.jpg)

Three Mile Island Unit 2 suffered a partial core meltdown only months after it began commercial operation. It is the worst nuclear accident in the US despite releasing only a tiny amount of radiation to the environment. The plant is in SAFSTOR. Unit 1 continued to operate for 40 years after the TMI-2 accident, finally shutting down in September 2019 due to economic factors.
