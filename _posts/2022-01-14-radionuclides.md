Using precise and accurate terminology is not always the most important thing when you're, say, shitposting on twitter, but I've noticed there is frequent confusion online about the term isotope, and exactly what it refers to. Also, what is a nuclide and when should you use isotope vs nuclide?

Of course, no one is going to force you to use the correct terminology unless you're in the process of learning or conducing nuclear physics/engineering/science, but if you want to sound like you Know What You're Talking About, here is a quick guide.

## Nuclide

Nuclide is the umbrella term for "atoms that have some number of protons and neutrons". This is like a nuclear version of the word element. Element refers to atoms that are defined by a fixed number of protons. Carbon is an element, and it always has six protons.

In chemistry, one typically cares only about the element (protons) and how many electrons an atom has, which determines its chemical properties.

In nuclear science however, the number of neutrons is important as well as the number of protons and electrons. When the nuclear properties _matter_ (they don't always), and you just want to talk about some number of atoms of unknown or variable element, you would call them nuclides. Some nuclides you've probably never heard of are cerium-122 and holmium-177, because I just randomly found them online. It's ok if you've never heard of the elements, either.

If you want to talk about radioactive atoms, but your conversation is not necessarily limited to a single element, those would be radioactive nuclides, or radionuclides. A few examples of radionuclides:

- uranium-235, which has 92 protons and 143 neutrons
- hydrogen-3, which has 1 proton and 2 neutrons. It is often referred to as tritium
- carbon-14, which has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. This is the type of radioactive carbon important for carbon dating of organic material, along with the non-radioactive carbon-12

Aside: just like there is a periodic table to visualize the elements, there is a nuclear version to visualize all the nuclides. It’s called, somewhat more dryly, the Chart of the Nuclides. It’s basically if you lined up all the elements on the Y axis. A types of hydrogen have a y value, or Proton number, of 1. Then add a second axis of neutron number. Voila)

I also really like this [3D chart of the nuclides](https://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~ecs103/chart3d/) by [Ed Simpson](https://twitter.com/SuperSubatomic)</small>

### ...ok, so what's an isotope?

Isotope is used to specify a _nuclide_ (using the new vocab word right away!) of a specific element. For example, if we're *only* talking about uranium, then we can talk about isotopes of uranium. Uranium-235 has 3 fewer neutrons than uranium-238.

U-235 and U-238 are isotopes of uranium, but they're not the only isotopes. Not even the only naturally-occuring isotopes of uranium in greater than trace quantities, we are reminded by uranium-234 if it was anthropomorphized. They're also nuclides, but calling them isotopes reminds us they are the same element and have the same number of protons.

Conversely, uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are not isotopes. They are different elements, with uranium always having 92 protons and plutonium always having 94.<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary" />

Self-check: Are all isotopes nuclides? Are all nuclides isotopes? Think about it, and see the answer at the bottom of the page

Another common mistake is assuming that nuclides or isotopes are the same as saying radionuclide or radioisotope. Carbon-12 and oxygen-16 are _nuclides_, and they're not radioactive. Hydrogen-1 and hydrogen-2 (aka deuterium) are _isotopes_ of hydrogen, and they're both stable too.

However, using the word nuclide or isotope generally means that the nuclear properties are important to the story for some reason. Hydrogen-1, or protium (but who calls it that?) and deuterium are not radioactive, but they have different nuclear properties. Which one you put in your nuclear reactor is really important because it affects neutronic behavior. Keep that in mind next time you build yourself a nuclear reactor, will ya?

Also, there are other terms relating multiple nuclides to each other based on nuclear properties, including isobars, isotones, and isomers. These pop up in the media far less freqently, so just google them if you're curious.

### Thanks for this, but why?

It's a _rare_ day when I actually get to be pendantic about an xkcd comic. Randall Munroe usually does a fantastic job when weaving nuclear science into comics, but in this case he just happened to stumble into the trap of an extremely common mistake. Comic [2568](https://xkcd.com/2568/) uses isotope when the element is not specified or fixed, and should instead be nuclide.

Spinthariscopes, a neat tool to visualize radiation that are almost as old as our knowledge of radioativity itself, were historically made using radium as the _radionuclide_, but modern versions generally use americium-241 or thorium, such as the one avaiable for purchase at [United Nuclear](https://unitednuclear.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=2_12). 

Note I reference thorium instead of thorium-232. Because thorium has only one naturally occuring _isotope_, it's common practice to omit the mass number (protons plus neutrons).

# To Summarize

If you're talking about a single element:
- isotope(s)
- radioisotope(s) if you know it's radioative. Or radioactive isotope, which some people prefer

If you are talking about multiple elements, or you don't have enough info to know for sure:
- nuclide(s)
- radionuclide(s) if you know it's radioactive. Or radioactive nuclide, it's the same thing

Self-check answer: This is like squares and rectangles. Isotopes are to squares as nuclides are to rectangles. Isotope is simply a more precise way to describe nuclides, when they are the same element.
