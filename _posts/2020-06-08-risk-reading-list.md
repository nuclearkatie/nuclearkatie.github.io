Nuclear engineers have to be communicators; the very name of our field invites curiosity and questioning. Yet many, maybe most, nuclear engineering students get no formal training in communicating science to the public, let alone a deep dive into the field that studies the science of communicating science.

After a few requests, I decided to put together a short introductory list of journal articles for people interested in risk communication. This is barely enough to get your feet wet, but these papers cover topics from how and why people perceive risks to the values that influence whether people feel positively or negatively about nuclear power.

Disclaimer, I'm not an expert in science communication, I haven't gotten to conduct research in the field (yet), but I have been learning from experts, taking graduate-level college courses, and most of all, reading the scientific literature for a few years now.

This is a living list. Last updated: June 8, 2020

If you're looking for my slides from the 2020 ANS Annual Meeting presentation, you can find them <a href="/Mummah_Risk_Society.pdf" class="button">          HERE          </a>
