Nuclear engineers have to be communicators; the very name of our field invites curiosity and questioning. Yet many, maybe most, nuclear engineering students get no formal training in communicating science to the public, let alone a deep dive into the field that studies the science of communicating science.

After a few requests, I decided to put together a short introductory list of journal articles for people interested in risk communication. This is barely enough to get your feet wet, but these papers cover topics from how and why people perceive risks to the values that influence whether people feel positively or negatively about nuclear power.

Disclaimer, I have not yet gotten to conduct significant academic research in the field of science communication (yet), but I have been learning from experts, taking graduate-level college courses, and most of all, reading the scientific literature for years now.

This is a living list. First published: June 8, 2020. Last updated: May 20, 2021

I want to specifically thank Professor [Dominique Brossard](https://lsc.wisc.edu/facstaff/brossard-dominique/) in the department of Life Sciences Communication and Professor [Vicki Bier](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/faculty/bier_vicki) in Industrial & Systems Engineering for being the ones to assign most of (potentially all?) of these readings to me and for teaching me so much.

If you have any thoughts or would like to add articles to miy list (it's far from a comprehensive source, but I always welcome new additions that may be of interest to engineers without formal social science training), you can either [Contact Me](/contact), or [open an issue on the GitHub repo for this website](https://github.com/nuclearkatie/nuclearkatie.github.io/issues)
