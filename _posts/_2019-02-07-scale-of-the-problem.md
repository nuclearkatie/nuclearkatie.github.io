The past five years have been the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2018-was-4th-hottest-year-on-record-for-globe">five hottest years</a> for the globe in human record. In an attempt to limit this warming to a target level of 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius, carbon emissions must be lowered drastically.

Many proposals have been laid out to lower our carbon emissions from the electricity, transportation, agriculture, residential, and industrial sectors. One proposal, the Green New Deal created by freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), has recently released the final text of the non-binding <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5729033-Green-New-Deal-FINAL">resolution</a>. It resolves to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions, a huge undertaking. But as the US and the world set out to tackle this problem, it's important to understand the context of energy use today.

To put things in perspective, the US gets about 30% of our energy from coal. We used about <a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/index.php">715,000,000,000 short tons of coal</a> in 2017. That's an unimaginably large number, so let's break it down a bit. You could pack <a href="http://attstadium.com">AT&T Stadium</a>, where the Dallas Cowboys play, full of coal over 275,000 times with that much coal. The largest building in the world by usable space, the < a href="https://www.boeing.com/company/about-bca/everett-production-facility.page">Boeing Everett Factory</a>, could be filled more than 60,000 times. If you break that volume of coal down per person, it would fill about 82 dump trucks. That's 82 dump trunks of coal for every person in the US, every year.

It's a similar story for natural gas, which makes up the largest share of electricity generation since 2015. Natural gas continues to grow as an energy source, with plenty more capacity set to come online in 2019 and beyond.

With about two-thirds of our electricity coming from fossil fuels, the Green New Deal and other proposals to lower carbon emissions have a big task ahead of them.
