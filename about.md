Katie Mummah recently graduated with a PhD in [Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/nuclear-engineering-engineering-physics/) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). She also earned a graduate certificate in [Life Science Communication](https://lsc.wisc.edu/academic-programs/graduatecertificate) and a graduate certificate in [Energy Analysis and Policy](https://eap.wisc.edu/). While at UW, Katie worked in the <a href="https://cnerg.github.io">Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG)</a> under Professor Paul Wilson and spent several years conducting dissertation research at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.

Katie's research interests revolve around the overlap between the nuclear fuel cycle, advanced reactors, nuclear nonproliferation, and computational science and engineering. Her goal is to ensure that the use of nuclear power remains peaceful around the world and that nuclear materials are kept safe and secure. She is deeply involved in the <a href="https://ans.org">American Nuclear Society</a>, including having served as the chair of the Student Sections Committee, which oversees all student chapters and activities of ANS.

You can often find her <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nuclearkatie.com">posting on Bluesky</a> about clean energy and decarbonization between her research. Her tweets often focus communication and eduction of nuclear science and engineering, as well as important parts of the nuclear fuel cycle such as uranium mine [remediation] and radioactive waste management.

Katie grew up in the Chicago suburbs and earned her B.S. in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
