Katie Mummah is a [Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/engineering-physics/) PhD student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu), with a PhD minor in [Life Science Communication](https://lsc.wisc.edu/academic-programs/ph-d-minor/#ph-d-minor-alumni) and a graduate certificate in [Energy Analysis and Policy](https://eap.wisc.edu/). She works in the <a href="https://cnerg.github.io">Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG)</a> under Professor Paul Wilson.

All of Katie's personal and professional work is driven by two of the largest problems facing our world today: climate change and nuclear weapons. While her research is focused directly on nuclear power, Katie also writes about the broader need to decarbonize our world and the promising strategies to do so.

Katie's research interests revolve around the overlap between the nuclear fuel cycle, advanced reactors, nuclear nonproliferation, and computational science and engineering. Her goal is to ensure that the use of nuclear power remains peaceful around the world and that nuclear materials are kept safe and secure. She is deeply involved in the <a href="https://ans.org">American Nuclear Society</a>, including currently serving as the chair of the Student Sections Committee, which oversees all student chapters and activities of ANS.

You can often find her <a href="https://twitter.com/nuclearkatie">tweeting</a> about clean energy and decarbonization between her research. Her tweets often focus communication and eduction of nuclear science and engineering, as well as important parts of the nuclear fuel cycle such as uranium mine [remediation] and radioactive waste management.

Katie grew up in the Chicago suburbs and earned her B.S. in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering from the University of Illinois. Besides Wisconsin and Illinois, she has briefly lived in New Jersey, Idaho, and New Mexico. She loves backpacking, skiing, volunteering at dog sled races, and mentoring students.
